### Sandan (3rd degree black belt), Fukushidoin (certified "Assistant Instructor" by the U.S. Aikido Federation)

Marie began practicing aikido in 2004 at Aikido Schools of New Jersey with Richard Stickles Shihan. Upon advancement, she started to visit and train at other dojos, especially Aikido of Red Bank, where she reconnected with another fellow ASNJ alumni and her beloved late husband, James Shaffer, Shidoin, whose unique approach, skill set, and teaching style influenced hers immensely. Together they reopened Long Beach Island Aikikai in Manahawkin in 2011, with the help and under the direction of Chester Griffin Shihan, who awarded her the title of Fukushidoin in 2023.

Marie hopes to honor Jimmy's legacy and memory by leading his classes and continuing to practice, study, and attend various seminars. She currently works professionally as a graphic artist with a degree in visual communications.
