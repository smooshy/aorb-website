### Godan (5th degree black belt), Shidoin (certified "Instructor" by the U.S. Aikido Federation), In Memoriam

James was a student of martial arts from childhood, who began practicing Aikido in 1998 at the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey Aikido Club. Shortly after, he served as soto deshi under Chester Griffin of the Long Beach Island Aikikai. A move north took him to Aikido Schools of New Jersey in Roselle Park under the direction of Shihan Richard Stickles. Upon another move to Manhattan, he became a member of the New York Aikikai. Once back in New Jersey, he split his time on the instructional staff at Long Beach Island Aikikai, Aikido Schools of New Jersey and Aikido of Red Bank. He left us suddenly and all to early on December 11, 2022.
