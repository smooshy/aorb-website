### Yondan (4th degree black belt), Fukushidoin (certified "Assistant Instructor" by the U.S. Aikido Federation)

Lee began studying Aikido by watching the opening class of Aikido of Red Bank on April 8, 2002. He joined the dojo that night and has been training ever since. With no previous martial arts background, he began training as much as his schedule would allow. He achieved the rank of Shodan (first degree black belt) in 2008. He volunteers a considerable amount of time and was instrumental in helping to find, secure the lease for, and decorate our entire dojo space.

His background in Corporate America spans 34 years in Telecommunications and Information Technology at IBM and the Bell System. That experience has enabled him to assist in marketing and managing the business aspects of the dojo. He retired in 1999 and lives in Lincroft with his wife Mary.

In 2019 he underwent two total knee replacements. After extensive rehab, he recovered completely and has been training happily ever after.

He has also been training in Kuntaw Kali Kruzada under Maestro Rich Acosta since 2013. In addition, he has been studying "Battodo", a Japanese sword art, under Sensei Russ Gordon since 2015. He is an active woodworker and teaches woodturning in his shop. He plays golf any time the weather permits, practices yoga daily, enjoys fine food and beverages, and has entirely too much fun.
