### Nidan (2nd degree black belt)

Stan began studying Aikido at the New York Aikikai in 1973, taking classes with Yoshimitsu Yamada Sensei, Lou Kleinsmith and his brother Bob Lumish. At that time, he learned the Tâ€™ai Chi form as taught by Professor Cheng Man-Ching, which he continues to practice today. After taking a hiatus from Aikido, he returned to the mat to train with Rick Stickles Sensei in Red Bank. He has since been practicing with Jim Soviero Sensei. Stan finds Aikido to be a wonderful exercise for body, mind and spirit.
