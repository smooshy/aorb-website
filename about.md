Aikido – the “way to harmony with spirit” - strives ideally to avoid an attack altogether, combining awareness of self and situation, non-confrontational body posture and calm demeanor. But if an attack should occur, Aikido teaches how to effectively defend oneself while also protecting those attacking. This is the practice of true Budo, acknowledging the preciousness of all life. The techniques of Aikido are characterized by an emphasis on getting off the line of attack, blending with and redirecting an attacker's energy, taking their balance and finishing with a throw and/or a pin. It is not a fighting art but instead a way to defuse aggression through a peaceful yet powerful art form.

## Origin

Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art developed in the first half of the 20th century by Morihei Ueshiba, to whom practitioners refer as O-Sensei or Great Teacher. It is the synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy, and spiritual beliefs. While Aikido has its roots in several older, long-established Japanese martial arts, especially sword and spear, jujutsu and judo, the art is ever evolving.

## Our Dojo

Aikido of Red Bank was founded in 2002 by Chief Instructor James Soviero, and moved to its current location behind the Berkshire Hathaway (formerly Gloria Nilson) building in 2008. Aikido of Red Bank trains in traditional Aikikai style and is a member of United States Aikido Federation. We are a diverse community of like-minded people who support one another in the rigorous yet joyful practice of Aikido.
