The best way to get started is to come and participate in a **FREE** class.

* Come to our dojo, located in the back of the Berkshire Hathaway (formerly Gloria Nilson) building (at 350 Highway 35 South, just past Crown Tire).
* Wear either a gi or uniform if you have one or otherwise loose-fitting pants and a comfortable shirt (typically sweatpants and a T-shirt - avoid wearing shorts), and remove any loose jewelry.
* We typically recommend the Monday evening 6 PM class where we tend to focus on basics. But if that does not work for your schedule, any class labeled All Levels would be appropriate. For Children, any of the three weekly classes work fine.
* Arrive ten minutes or so before class, be sure to introduce yourself to the instructor and make us aware of any physical or health concerns you may have.
* You are also welcome to observe class as often as you like.
* For info or questions phone (732) 224-8910, or email [info@aikidoredbank.com](mailto:info@aikidoredbank.com).
