The Children's Program at Aikido of Red Bank teaches your child to roll and fall safely, breathe more effectively, relax, respond appropriately to a bully and to feel better about themselves and others.

The classes are conducted in a safe, friendly atmosphere that allows children to develop at their own pace.

We offer [multiple classes per week]({{ 'schedule/children' | relative_url }}) lead by teachers with many years of experience teaching aikido to children.
